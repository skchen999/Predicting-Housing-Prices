# Predicting-Housing-Prices

In this project, we predict the prices of homes sold in Ames, Iowa, from January 2006 through July 2010. This data was obtained from the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle competition. The data contains 80 features about 1,460 houses sold in this time frame. The goal of this project is to utilize feature engineering and regressions to accurately predict the price of a house.
